#  NJ government rakes in over $1 million from sports bets in first month!

After legalizing sports betting in the state, the NJ government raked in over $1 million from bets in the first month! This is a major win for the state, which is looking to benefit from the growing industry.

The total amount of money wagered on sports in NJ was over $3 million, with the state taking home more than a third of that. This is a clear indication that sports betting is going to be a major money-maker for NJ, and could help to boost the state's economy.

It's also great news for New Jersey taxpayers, who will see some of that money returned to them in the form of tax revenue. This is a welcome relief after years of budget cuts and austerity measures.

Sports betting has been legal in other states for years, but New Jersey is one of the first to legalize it since the Supreme Court struck down PASPA last year. This ruling opened up the market for sports betting, and states are now rushing to take advantage of it.

NJ was quick to act, and it is already paying off handsomely. Other states would be wise to follow its lead and legalize sports betting before they miss out on this lucrative opportunity.

#  NJ sports betting exceeding revenue predictions!

In the first year of sports betting in New Jersey, revenue is exceeding predictions by $1 million! This is great news for New Jersey, as it means that the state will be able to bring in more money to help fund important projects.

Governor Phil Murphy has stated that this additional revenue will help to improve transportation, schools, and other important infrastructure in the state. Sports betting has already proven to be a popular activity in New Jersey, with over $500 million wagered in the first year.

This success is due in part to the fact that New Jersey has some of the most liberal gambling laws in the country. Other states are now looking to follow New Jersey's example and legalize sports betting. This could lead to even more revenue for states that do so, as well as create new jobs in the gambling industry.

It remains to be seen whether sports betting will have a negative impact on the traditional gambling industry. Some experts believe that there may be a cannibalization effect, as people switch from casino games to sports betting. However, others believe that this will not be a major issue, and that the two industries can coexist peacefully.

Overall, it seems clear that sports betting is here to stay and that it is providing a significant boost to state revenues. This could have a major impact on the economy and on state governments across the country.

#  Sports betting in NJ a huge success, generating millions for the state government!

New Jersey sports betting was off to a roaring start in 2018, with more than $1.5 million bet on Super Bowl LII alone. The total amount of money gambled on sports in the state during the first two months of operation was more than $50 million!

This was great news for the New Jersey state government, which received more than $3 million in taxes from sports betting in February alone. This is a clear sign that sports betting can be a huge revenue generator for states, and is likely to be legalized in many more states in the coming years.

The success of sports betting in NJ is also good news for the casino industry, as it will help to bring more gamblers through their doors. This could lead to increased profits and jobs in the casino industry, as well as further tax revenue for the state government.

Overall, it seems that New Jersey's foray into legal sports betting has been a big success so far. This is likely to lead to other states following suit and legalizing this popular form of gambling.

#  New Jersey's sports betting boom putting more money into state coffers!

New Jersey's sports betting boom is putting more money into state coffers, with tax revenue from the industry up more than fivefold in the past fiscal year.

The state Division of Gaming Enforcement said Tuesday that sports books took in nearly $277 million in bets during the fiscal year that ended June 30. That's up from about $52 million the year before.

State officials said taxes and licensing fees generated from sports betting totaled nearly $13 million, compared with about $2.5 million the year before.

#  NJ government sees big profits from sports betting; residents could benefit too!

New Jersey's state government is raking in big profits from sports betting and taxpayers could benefit too, recent reports show.

Since sports betting was legalized in the state in June 2018, the government has taken in more than $185 million in revenue, according to figures released last week by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. That's more than twice what the state took in during the same period last year from traditional casino gambling.

Most of that money has come from out-of-state bettors, who have placed more than $1.5 billion worth of wagers since legalization. But New Jersey residents are also placing bets, and the revenue generated from their bets is being used to fund programs that benefit them.

For example, some of the money is being used to help pay for senior citizen housing, drug treatment and other services. In addition, a portion of the revenue is being set aside to help cover the costs associated with hosting major sporting events, such as this year's Super Bowl.

The fact that New Jersey is benefiting from sports betting while also providing important services to its residents is good news for all involved. It shows that this new form of gambling can be a win-win situation for everyone involved.
