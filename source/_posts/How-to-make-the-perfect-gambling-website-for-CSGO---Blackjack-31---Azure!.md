#  How to make the perfect gambling website for CSGO - Blackjack 31 - Azure!

Creating a gambling website for CSGO can be a daunting task. In this article, we will outline the process of creating a Blackjack 31 site on Azure using ASP.NET Core 2.0 and angular 4. We will also look at some of the benefits of using Azure over other platforms. So let‚Äôs get started!

The first step is to create an Azure account. You can do this by visiting https://azure.microsoft.com and clicking on ‚ÄúCreate a Free Account‚Äù. Once you have registered, you will need to create a new resource group. This can be done by clicking on the Resources tab and then selecting ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù in the bottom left corner:

Next, select ‚ÄúResource Group‚Äù and provide a name for your group. Click on ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù to proceed:

You will then be taken to the main Azure dashboard where you will see all of your resources listed under their respective groups:

In order to create our gambling website, we will need to deploy some resources into our group. The first resource we need is an instance of Windows Server with IIS and ASP.NET Core 2 installed. This can be done by clicking on ‚ÄúCreate a resource‚Äù in the top left corner, then selecting ‚ÄúCloud Services‚Äù and finally ‚ÄúWindows Server 2016 Datacenter‚Äù:

Once you have created the server, you will need to open it up in the portal by selecting it and clicking on the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù button:

You should now see the server dashboard where you can start/stop the server, configure settings and view logs:

To install IIS and ASP.NET Core 2 onto the server, we will use PowerShell commands. You can run these commands by opening PowerShell as administrator and running the following commands:


git clone https://github.com/aspnet/Get-Latest

Install-Module -Name Get-Latest -Repository PSGallery

 Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server,Web-Asp-Net45 -Source D:\sources\Sxs

Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.All -ProviderName NuGet -Version 2.0.*

Once IIS is installed, we need to create a web application for our gambling site. To do this, we will use the scaffolding tool Yeoman which is installed alongside npm (Node Package Manager). We can install Yeoman by running the following command in PowerShell:

npm install -g yo

Once Yeoman is installed, we can scaffold our web application by running the following command from within our project directory:

yo aspnetcore

This will prompt you to select which template you would like to use for your project ‚Äì in this case, we will select "ASP NET Core Web Application". Give your project a name and click "OK":

Yeoman will then generate all of the necessary files and folders for your project:

We now need to configure our application so that it knows how to connect to our Azure server instance. To do this, we need to create an appsettings file called appsettings.<environment>.json where <environment> corresponds to either development or production . We can do this by running the following command from within our project directory:

yo aspnetcore[appsettings]

This command will prompt you for input ‚Äì enter "Blackjack31" for Name and "https://<YOUR_SERVER_NAME>.cloudapp.azure sonicwall vpn client iphone com/" for EndpointUrl : ‡∏¢‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö ‡πÄ‡∏ß‡πá‡∏ö Gclub ‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà Èæô8ÂõΩÈôÖÂ®±‰πêÊâãÊú∫Áâà wwwks25comcn

 { name : "Blackjack31", endpointUrl : "https://<YOUR_SERVER_NAME>.cloudapp azure sonicwall vpn client iphone com)", }

#  Gambling 101: How to beat the casino every time with Blackjack 31 - Azure!

## Learning blackjack

Casinos have always been a popular destination for gambling, and blackjack is one of the most popular games. Learning how to play blackjack takes some time, but if you can master it you can beat the casino every time. Here we will teach you the basics of blackjack, so that you can start playing and have a chance of winning.

Blackjack is a game where you compete against the dealer to see who can get closest to 21 without going over. The game starts with both you and the dealer getting two cards each. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over ‚Äì this is known as a ‚Äòblackjack‚Äô. Face cards (King, Queen and Jack) are worth 10 points each, and an Ace can be worth 1 or 11 depending on what would make the best hand. Other cards are worth their face value.

If you have a total of 21 with your first two cards (known as a ‚Äònatural blackjack‚Äô), then you automatically win unless the dealer also has a 21. If your first two cards add up to more than 21, then you ‚Äòbust‚Äô and lose immediately. If your total is less than 21, then you can decide whether to take another card (known as ‚Äòhitting‚Äô) or stop (known as ‚Äòstanding‚Äô). You can hit as many times as you like, but if you go over 21 then you bust and lose automatically. The dealer must hit on 16 or below, and stand on 17 or above.

The aim is to get closer to 21 than the dealer, without busting. If your total is higher than the dealers, then you win automatically ‚Äì except in certain circumstances which we will come onto later! If your total is lower than the dealers, then you lose automatically. In order to win at blackjack, it‚Äôs important to understand when it‚Äôs best to hit and when it‚Äôs best to stand ‚Äì let‚Äôs take a look at some scenarios:

If your first two cards are an Ace and 10 (known as a ‚Äòsoft hand‚Äô), then the safest thing to do is stand because even if the dealer gets Blackjack (an Ace plus another card), they will still lose because they cannot go over 21. However if the dealer has 3, 4, 5 or 6 then hitting could be sensible in order to try and get closer to 21 without going bust; likewise if your first two cards are any other combination where hitting would give you a better chance of not going bust than standing, then go ahead and hit!

If your first two cards are 2 and 3 (a ‚Äòhard hand‚Äô), then it‚Äôs generally best to hit because there is no risk of going bust by taking another card. However if the dealer has 7 or 8 then standing might be a better option in case they draw another card that takes them closer to 21 than you.

As well as understanding when it‚Äôs best to hit or stand, it‚Äôs also important to keep track of how many decks are being used in the game ‚Äì this affects how likely it is for either yourself or the dealer to get Blackjack. Generally speaking, using more decks makes Blackjack less likely but also means that there are more different card combinations in play which makes winning strategies more complex - unless of course casino uses an infinite deck shuffling machine üôÇ . Finally we'll mention splitting - splitting allows players with 2 identical valued cards (eg Jack + Jack)to separate these into 2 seperate hands , with each receiving an additional card for those hands only . spliting increases player's chances somewhat , but comes at cost of doubling bet amount .
