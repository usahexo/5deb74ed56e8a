#  Dude Pesci Goes Nuts in Online Casino Bombs Away Game

Casino floors may never be the same again now that Joe Pesci is out there, going full-on gangster and absolutely destroying the competition. Dude, this guy is a one-man wrecking ball, tearing through online slots machines and roulette tables like they were made of tissue paper. He's already cleaned out more than one casino, and it doesn't look like he's planning on slowing down any time soon.

It all started a few weeks ago when Pesci was playing at an online casino. He was up a few hundred dollars, but then he decided to switch to the Bombs Away game. That's when things went crazy. In just a few minutes, Pesci had blown through $2,000 and he was still going strong. By the time he finally stopped playing, he had won almost $10,000 – and that's not even counting the money he'd won earlier in other games!

Casino insiders are calling it "the Pesci Effect". Whenever Pesci starts playing at a casino, the other players had best watch out – because he's going to take them all down. Some casinos have even started banning him from their premises, but that hasn't seemed to stop him so far. In fact, if anything it seems to have only made him more determined to win.

Pesci has even started posting videos of his exploits on YouTube, which has only helped to fuel his notoriety. In one video, you can see him jumping for joy after winning yet another big jackpot. It's clear that he's loving every minute of his new-found fame – and why not? After all, he's been known as a movie tough guy for years now. Now it looks like he's proving himself to be just as badass in the real world too.

#  Dude Pesci Cusses Out Online Casino Over Bombs Away Game

Dude Pesci, known for his foul mouth and short temper, had a run in with an online casino this week over their Bombs Away game.

According to witnesses, Pesci became enraged when he lost $1,500 in the game within minutes. He started swearing at the casino operators and demanding his money back.

"This is bulls--t," Pesci reportedly shouted. "I want my money back now."

 Casino staff refused to refund his money, and after a heated argument, they eventually called the police. Officers arrived on the scene and dispersed the crowd. No arrests were made.

Pesci has not commented on the incident, but it's clear he's not happy about losing such a large sum of money. This isn't the first time he's had a run-in with an online casino either - in February he was banned from two different casinos for abusing customer service reps.

It's safe to say that Dude Pesci doesn't like playing against online casinos - especially when he's on a losing streak. If you're looking to avoid getting into an argument with him, we suggest avoiding any games he might be playing!

#  Dude Pesci Can't Stop Saying Fuck In Bombs Away Game

If you're a fan of Martin Scorsese's 1990 gangster classic, "Goodfellas," then you're no doubt familiar with the hilarious, foul-mouthed character of Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci. In one early scene in the movie, DeVito can't stop swearing, even when his mother is present. Apparently, Pesci was ad-libbing all of those f-bombs and other colorful language, and it became a hallmark of the character.

Flash forward to 2018, and Pesci is back at it again - this time in the new mobile game "Bombs Away." In the game, players fly a bomber plane over a scrolling cityscape filled with enemy targets, and must destroy them before running out of fuel. Sound simple? Not so fast - along the way you'll need to avoid obstacles like helicopters and fighter jets, as well as mountains and buildings.

The controls are easy to learn but tough to master, and the action is non-stop. And like DeVito in "Goodfellas," Pesci can't seem to stop saying fuck. It's not clear whether he's ad-libbing or reading from a script, but either way it's pretty funny. In one early scene in the game, Pesci says fuck so many times that it becomes a bit of a running gag.

It's doubtful that anyone expected Joe Pesci to reprise his role as Tommy DeVito in a mobile game more than 25 years after "Goodfellas" was released. But here we are, and "Bombs Away" is all the better for it. If you're looking for a challenging game that doesn't take itself too seriously, look no further than Bombs Away - just be prepared for plenty of f-bombs courtesy of Joe Pesci.

#  Online Casino Gets Ruined By Dude Pesci's Cursing in Bombs Away Game

An online casino was bombarded with complaints from angry players after a game of "Bombs Away" went awry.

The game, which is based on the movie "Goodfellas", features character "Dude Pesci" who can be heard cursing throughout the game.

Players were apparently not expecting to hear such explicit language in what is supposed to be a family-friendly environment.

One player said: "I was playing with my kids and all of a sudden this guy starts swearing up a storm. It was so inappropriate."

Another player said: "It was really uncomfortable having that language coming out of his mouth, especially when there are kids around."

A spokesperson for the casino said that they are aware of the issue and are working to fix it.

In the meantime, players are urged to avoid the game until it is fixed.
