#  SPORTS BETTING NOW LEGAL IN NEW JERSEY!

On June 11, 2018, New Jersey became the second state in the nation to legalize sports betting (after Delaware), with Governor Phil Murphy signing the bill into law. The NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and NCAA all opposed the measure, but it became law anyway.

Legal sports betting in New Jersey will include both in-person and online wagering. The legislation allows Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, as well as online platforms operated by the casinos and tracks. Betting on professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey, and auto racing is allowed.

The Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport is expected to be the first venue to offer legal sports betting in New Jersey. William Hill US has been tapped as the exclusive gaming partner at Monmouth Park. Sports betting operations are scheduled to begin at Monmouth Park on July 14th.

In anticipation of legalized sports betting in New Jersey, several Atlantic City casinos have already begun construction on new or expanded sportsbooks. Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa plans to spend $5 million on a major renovation of its race and sports book lounge. Caesars Entertainment is expanding its sportsbook at Harrah's Resort Atlantic City by 3,000 square feet. And Golden Nugget Atlantic City is building a new 7,500-square-foot facility that will include a retail store and kitchen.

Connecticut residents rejoiced this week when they learned that they could now legally place sports bets. This is great news for those who enjoy betting on sports, as Connecticut is home to some of the best teams in the country.

There are many different ways to bet on sports, and the options available in Connecticut will vary depending on the particular sporting event. You can bet on the outcome of a game, who will win a particular matchup, or how many points will be scored.

No matter what sport you’re interested in betting on, there’s a good chance that you can do so in Connecticut. The state has recently allowed betting on horse racing, professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer.

Once you’ve registered for an account, you can deposit funds and then begin placing bets. Most sites offer free bets for new members, so be sure to take advantage of this offer.

One thing to keep in mind when placing bets is that it’s important to research the teams involved thoroughly. This includes looking at past performances as well as current injuries and other factors that could affect the game. It’s also important to find a reputable bookie who offers competitive odds and streamed live information so that you can stay up-to-date with all the latest developments.

So whether you’re a seasoned pro or just getting started, Connecticut is definitely worth checking out for all your sports betting needs!

#  GET READY FOR SPORTS BETTING IN CONNECTICUT - OFFICIALLY LAUNCHING SOON!

Connecticut is gearing up for the formal launch of legalized sports betting, with preparations well underway at the state’s racetracks and casinos.

The long-awaited launch comes after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had effectively outlawed sports betting outside of Nevada.

Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize the practice, including Connecticut.

There are now plans for sportsbooks to open at two tribal casinos and two harness racing tracks in the state.

It’s expected that these venues will offer retail and online sports betting services, with fans able to place bets on a range of sporting events, including NFL, NBA, MLB and NCAA games.

In anticipation of the launch, MGM Resorts – one of the leading casino operators in Connecticut – has already been granted a license to offer sports betting services.

The company is planning to open its own sportsbook at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket.

Other casino operators are also expected to get into the Sports Betting game, including Wynn Resorts and Caesars Entertainment Corporation.

#  CALIFORNIA MAY BE NEXT STATE TO LEGALIZE SPORTS BETTING; SV88 PARTNERS WITH NEVADA CASINOS

As the US Supreme Court weighs a case that could legalize sports gambling nationwide, industry experts are watching to see whether CA will become the next state to join NV in legalizing sports betting.

SV88 has partnered with a number of Nevada casinos to offer its cutting-edge sports betting technology in advance of any potential nationwide legalization. SV88’s CEO, Alex Dreyfus, said CA is a key market for the company.

“California is a huge market for us – it’s the most populous state in the US and there are lots of potential customers here,” Dreyfus said.

If SCOTUS rules in favor of legalized sports betting, CA is likely to follow NV’s lead in enacting regulatory frameworks to allow casinos and other gaming operators to offer this service. This would make SV88 one of the biggest players in the burgeoning US sports betting market.

The global market for legal sports betting is estimated at $60 billion, with projections that it could reach as high as $200 billion once legalized in the US. The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that there are $150 billion wagered illegally on sports each year in the US.

The AGA has been a leading advocate for legalized sports betting and believes that it can bring much-needed revenue to states and municipalities across the country. In addition to creating jobs and generating tax revenue, the AGA believes that legalized sports betting can help reduce illegal gambling activity.

“Illegal gambling is not a victimless crime,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA. “It harms individuals, families and communities across the country. Revenues from regulated sports betting can help offset these costs by funding addiction treatment programs, problem gambling prevention initiatives and law enforcement efforts."
