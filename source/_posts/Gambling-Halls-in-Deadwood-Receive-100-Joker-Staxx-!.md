#  Joker Staxx Adds Excitement to Gambling Halls in Deadwood!

It’s been less than a year since the legalization of sports betting in Deadwood and already one casino is making a big splash with a new game that has players on the edge of their seats. Joker Staxx, which is similar to poker but with several important twists, was recently introduced at the Silverado Casino and it’s already becoming one of the most popular games in town.

The basic premise of Joker Staxx is to bet on whether you think the next card will be higher or lower than the first card. After both players have made their bet, three cards are shown face up on the table. The player who selected higher now has two options: they can either keep betting that the next card will be higher, or they can switch to betting that the next card will be lower. The player who selected lower can likewise choose to keep betting that the next card will be lower, or switch to betting that the next card will be higher.

The twist in Joker Staxx is that if you select higher and the next card is lower, your bet is automatically doubled (assuming you haven’t gone bust by losing all your chips). If you select lower and the next card is higher, your bet is automatically lost (again, assuming you haven’t gone bust). This makes for an exciting game where fortunes can change in an instant!

Joker Staxx has quickly become a favorite among Deadwood locals and tourists alike. If you’re looking for a new and exciting game to try your hand at, be sure to check out Joker Staxx at the Silverado Casino!

#  More Fun at Deadwood Gambling Halls with 100 Joker Staxx!

Are you ready for some more fun at the Deadwood gambling halls? Then get ready to try out 100 Joker Staxx! This new and exciting game from Microgaming is a variation of the classic poker game Texas Hold ‘Em, but with an exciting joker twist that can see you winning big payouts.

To play 100 Joker Staxx, you first need to select your bet amount and then click on the Deal button to receive your two hole cards. In this game, the joker is wild and can be used as any other card in order to create a winning hand. After seeing your first two cards, you then have the option to either Fold or Raise. If you Fold, you lose your bet amount and if you Raise, you must place another bet that is double the size of your original bet.

Once all players have either Folded or Raised, the next stage of the game begins. The dealer will then reveal three community cards, also known as the flop. Players now have the opportunity to use any of their five cards in order to make the best hand possible. The fourth community card is revealed next (the turn) and finally the fifth and final community card (the river). The player with the best hand at this point wins the pot.
