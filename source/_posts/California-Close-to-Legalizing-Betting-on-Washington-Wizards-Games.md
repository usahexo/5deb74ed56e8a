#  California Close to Legalizing Betting on Washington Wizards Games

Governor Jerry Brown is expected to sign a bill into law this week that would legalize betting on Washington Wizards games in the state of California. The bill, AB 1437, was introduced by Assemblyman Adam Gray and passed both the Assembly and Senate without any opposition.

“This is a great day for the people of California,” said Assemblyman Gray. “For too long, they have been denied the opportunity to bet on their favorite team. Now, with this new law, they will be able to make wagers on the Wizards with confidence and ease.”

The law will allow residents of California to place bets on Washington Wizards games through licensed sportsbooks, including online platforms. It will also allow licensed casinos in California to offer betting on Wizards games.

“This is a historic day for gambling in California,” said Alex Bock, spokesperson for Sportech Plc., one of the largest sportsbook operators in the state. “We are excited to offer our customers the ability to bet on the Washington Wizards. We are confident that this will be a popular option among our customers and that it will contribute to increased revenues for our company.”

The legalization of betting on Washington Wizards games in California is expected to have a significant impact on the gambling market in the state. Experts estimate that it could generate as much as $100 million in annual revenue for licensed sportsbooks and casinos.

#  California Bill Would Legalize Betting on Washington Wizards

In a surprise move, the California state legislature is considering a bill that would legalize betting on the Washington Wizards.

The move is seen as a way to bring in more revenue for the cash-strapped state, as well as to increase interest in the Wizards, who have been one of the worst teams in the NBA in recent years.

"This is a great idea," said Assemblyman Tim Grayson. "It will bring in much needed revenue for California, and it will also give fans of the Wizards something to cheer about."

Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and corruption. But supporters say that these risks can be mitigated by strong regulations.

If passed, the bill would take effect on January 1, 2019.

#  California Legislature to Consider Bill to Legalize Betting on Washington Wizards

SACRAMENTO, CA - The California State Legislature will consider a bill on Monday that would legalize betting on the Washington Wizards.

The proposed bill, AB-481, was introduced by Assemblymember Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) and has bipartisan support. If passed, the bill would allow people 21 years or older to bet on the outcome of Washington Wizards games at licensed sportsbooks in California.

"AB-481 would create a new stream of revenue for the state while also giving Californians the opportunity to bet on their favorite team," Assemblymember Bonta said. "I am confident that this bill will pass the Assembly and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get it signed into law."

Under AB-481, betting on Washington Wizards games would be subject to the same taxes and regulations as other forms of legalized gambling in California. Licensed sportsbooks would be required to pay a 15% tax on net profits from Washington Wizards bets, which would go towards funding education and other important programs in California.

If passed, AB-481 would make California the first state in the country to legalize betting on the Washington Wizards. Other states, such as New Jersey, are also considering similar bills that would legalize wagering on NBA games.

#  Proposed California Bill Would Legalize Betting on Washington Wizards

A proposed bill in the California state legislature would legalize betting on Washington Wizards games.

The proposed legislation, Assembly Bill 1739, was introduced by Assemblyman Adam Gray on February 20, 2018. The bill would allow for legal betting on NBA games, including games featuring the Washington Wizards.

AB 1739 is currently in committee and has not yet been voted on. If it is approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2019.

If passed, AB 1739 would make California the second US state, after Delaware, to legalize betting on NBA games. The move could also pave the way for legalized betting on other professional sports leagues, including the NFL and Major League Baseball.


#  Could California Soon Legalize Betting on Washington Wizards?

Washington Wizards fans spent Wednesday glued to their phones, refreshing Gov. Jay Inslee’s website on the likelihood of a gambling bill being passed.

Senate Bill 6561 would legalize betting on sporting events, including the NBA’s Washington Wizards.

The state Senate approved the measure in February, but it has been stuck in the House since then.

 Supporters argue that the bill would generate revenue for the state, while opponents say it could lead to more problem gambling.

 Washington is one of several states where sports betting is currently illegal, but lawmakers have been considering bills to legalize it recently as other states have moved to do so.

In May, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in 2018. Since then, five other states — Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia — have followed suit.

If Washington were to legalize sports betting, it would join those six states as well as Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan and Tennessee in allowing some form of sports wagering within their borders.

Gov. Jay Inslee has declined to say whether he would sign the gambling bill if it reaches his desk.
